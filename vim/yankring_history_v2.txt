\section{Introduction}The most promising non-traditional propulsor concept involves tandem flapping foils (two hydrofoils, one roughly aft of the other). Current DON-funded research with tandem foils shows promising results and indicates that the high efficiency of a single flapping foil may be possible with a tandem foil arrangement [1,17].The geometric and kinematic description of a tandem foil propulsor is given in Figure [TWO FOIL FIGURE ANNOTATED].  Including the induced velocities (ux, uy), the angle of attack is:\begin{equation}\alpha(t) = \tan^{-1}\(\ddfrac{\ddx{h(t)}{t} - u_y(t)}{U + u_x(t)}]\) - \theta(t)\end{equation}such that the maximum angle of attack is roughly\begin{equation}  \alpha_{max} \approx \tan^{-1} (\pi\mathit{St}) - \theta_0\end{equation}As evident from this long list [INSERT LIST OF PARAMETERS?] of geometric and kinematic parameters, the design space for tandem flapping foil propulsion is enormous. The following design methodology applies:\begin{itemize_packed}  \item Choose the geometry and kinematics of the forward foil based on those optimal for an isolated foil.  \item Choose inter-foil phase angle $\phi$ to mitigate unsteady variation in thrust and side force.  \item Choose inter-foil separation $s$ to yield high efficiency.  \item Choose the geometry (e.g. span $b_2$) and kinematics (e.g. heave amplitude $h_{02}$) of the aft foil such that the aft foil ``fits'' in the wake of the forward foil.\end{itemize_packed}Justification of this design methodology follows: Prior work with tandem pitching foils has shown that high efficiency occurs when the upstream foil performs motions similar to the high-performance motions of an isolated foil [17,20,111,129].  PI Epps postulates that this is true because the main effect of the downstream foil on the upstream foil is to induce axial inflow (i.e. the time-averaged $u_x > 0$, but $uy \approx 0$).  This is akin to contra-rotating propellers, where the downstream rotor induces axial- but not swirl velocity on the upstream rotor [26,63]. The physics of isolated flapping foils is well known.  Triantafyllou et al. [114] showed that the wake dynamics of flapping foils are dominated by the Strouhal number, $\mathit{St} = fA/U$ where $A=2h_0$ is the wake width. They suggest that optimal efficiency is achieved for $0.25 < \mathit{St} < 0.35$. Further, Triantafyllou et al. [113] observed that many live fish swim in this Strouhal range.The wake morphology associated with maximum propulsive efficiency is a reverse K\'{a}rm\'{a}n street; the choreography is such that a leading edge vortex forms, is shed, and combines with trailing edge vorticity to produce two vortices per cycle (see Figure [INSERT ANDERSON WAKE MORPHOLOGY FIGURE?]) [2,3].  Many more experimental [93,94,123,124]  and computational [14,15,33,83,95,109,131] studies have led to a deep understanding of the propulsive performance and wake morphology in both 2D and 3D.  Non-sinusoidal motions (higher-order harmonics, sawtooth waveform, etc.) have been shown to increase thrust, but reduce efficiency [64,67,82,99].  One comprehensive review is [115]. In the tandem foil scenario, the downstream foil interacts with the wake of the upstream foil with the goal of producing an enhanced thrust-type wake. The general vorticity control problem has been studied experimentally [11,60,74,109]; these studies show that the wake of an upstream body can in fact be modified in a deliberate manner by a downstream flapping foil.The tandem flapping foil arrangement occurs in nature: The dragonfly has been studied extensively by the aeronautics community for its superior propulsive and maneuvering ability [5,16,32,66,76,80,105,111,125,126,129].  One important theoretical result in this literature is that harmonic motions produce thrust with no net side force.  To produce a net side force (say, for maneuvering), linear theory only requires a non-zero pitch offset: $\theta(t) = \theta_0\sin(2\pi ft) + \text{offset}$  [13,73,80,130].  This implies that, say, the aft foil can be used for both propulsion and steering.The most comprehensive experimental study of tandem flapping foils to date was performed by Boschitsch et al. [17], who considered the pitching motions of 2D foils for a range of inter-foil spacings and phase lags.  Prior experimental [101] and computational [1,20,21,22] studies considered only a subset of these test conditions, but considered foils moving in both pitch and heave.  The primary results from all of these studies are consistent: Thrust and efficiency can be enhanced or diminished depending on the combination of inter-foil spacing and phase lag.  At best, a tandem foil system can produce 150--280\% of the thrust at 150--180\% of the efficiency of a single foil ([17] and [1], respectively). Moreover, maximum thrust and efficiency occur together [17,76], which confirms that a tandem foil system is a viable ship propulsor. \section{Key Insight}The key insight in this proposal is that these kinematics can be chosen without sacrificing efficiency.  To achieve high efficiency for a chosen inter-foil phase lag $\phi$, one must set the inter-foil spacing s appropriately. Although not yet discussed in the literature, we observe that there exists a natural relationship between the inter-foil spacing and the optimum inter-foil phase lag (to maximize efficiency):\begin{equation}  \phi_{\mathit{optimum}} = \phi_0 + 2\pi\frac{s/U^*}{T} = \phi_0 + \frac{2\pi fs}{U^*}\end{equation}Here, $U^* = U + u_x$ represents the total (free-stream plus spatially-averaged wake-induced) velocity in the region between the foils.  The ratio $\frac{s}{U*}$ is the time required for vortex advection from upstream foil to downstream foil, and $T = 1/f$ is the flapping period, so $2\pi f s / U^*$ is the phase lag required for vortex advection. The phase offset $\phi_0$ is not a function of spacing $s$; it represents the actual choreography needed by the downstream foil for high efficiency (aside from waiting $2\pi f s / U^*$ for the upstream vortices to arrive).[INSERT BOSCHITSCH FIGURE HERE]Figure [BOSCHITSCH FIGURE] shows experimental results with pitching tandem foils [17]. Contours of maximum thrust and efficiency occur when $\phi = 2\pi - 2\pi\frac{\frac{s}{c}}{1.2}$. In this case, $\frac{fc}{U} = 1.0$, and they report $U^* = 1.2U$. Also, they define $\phi$ as a phase lead (i.e.\ negative of that herein). Thus, their experimental data shows\begin{equation}  \phi_{\mathit{optimum}} = \phi_0 + \frac{2\pi fs}{U^*}\end{equation}(where in this case $\phi_0 = 2\pi$). Similar results by other researchers with a 2D numerical simulation were reported at the 2014 APS-DFD conference [88].[INCLUDE OTHER RESULTS HERE]\section{Conclusions},V

Thus, their experimental data shows\begin{equation}  \phi_{\mathit{optimum}} = \phi_0 + \frac{2\pi fs}{U^*}\end{equation}(where in this case $\phi_0 = 2\pi$). Similar results by other researchers with a 2D numerical simulation were reported at the 2014 APS-DFD conference [88].[INCLUDE OTHER RESULTS HERE]\section{Conclusions}To recap, the hypothetical design procedure is to choose the phase lag $\phi$ to mitigate load variations, and then to choose the spacing $s$ to optimize efficiency.  For a given $\phi$, the spacing that optimizes efficiency is:  \begin{equation}  s_{\mathit{optimum}} = (\phi-\phi_0)\frac{U^*}{2\pi f} \end{equation}Although this is a simple relationship, it is not straightforward to use, because $\phi_0$ and $U^*$ are unknown.  However, these could be determined computationally using $s = \phi \frac{U}{2\pi f}$ as an initial guess, and then iterating over $s$ to find the maximum efficiency.This is a critical hypothesis to test, because it determines the viability of tandem flapping foils as a practical propulsor.  Recall, one major drawback of a single flapping foil is that it suffers large variation in instantaneous thrust and side force.  Tandem flapping foils do not necessarily solve this operational problem; in fact, researchers have reported higher fluctuations in instantaneous loads using tandem flapping foils, as compared to single foils (see Figure [NEED FIGURE OF INSTANTANTEOUS THRUST AND SIDE FORCE (NOT IN YIP ARTWORK FOLDER??]) [1].  However, we hypothesize that by deliberately choosing inter-foil phase lag $\phi$ and spacing $s$, one can design a tandem flapping foil propulsor that both \emph{(i)} produces high thrust at high efficiency, and \emph{(ii)} mitigates unsteady variation in thrust or side force.,V
