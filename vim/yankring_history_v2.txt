A novel trochoidal propeller using a sinusoidal blade pitch function was designed and tested, and a theoretical model to describe the principal physics governing the operation of such propellers was created. The main results presented herein are measurements of thrust and torque, as well as the calculated hydrodynamic efficiency, for a range of absolute advance coefficients.  The performance of the present sinusoidal-pitch trochoidal propeller is compared with prior cross-flow propellers, as well as a representative screw propeller. While the efficiency of the present propeller exceeds that of the cycloidal-pitch trochoidal propeller, it is slightly lower than the efficiencies of the other propellers considered. Model predictions show excellent agreement with the experimental data, which opens possibilities for future investigation and optimization of novel blade pitch motions. % \keywords{trochoidal propeller \and cycloidal propeller  \and cross-flow propeller }% \PACS{PACS code1 \and PACS code2 \and more}% \subclass{MSC code1 \and MSC code2 \and more}\end{abstract}%==============================================================================\section{Introduction}\label{intro}%==============================================================================As populations and the global economy grow, marine transport plays an increasingly important role in the economics of fossil fuels, food, raw materials, and finished products. Rising fuel costs and volatile markets have made the maritime industry a focus of increasing energy efficiency. Marine propulsion has been an important engineering problem for over two millennia \citep{Carlton1994}. Design of the modern screw propeller has evolved from the Archimedes' screw via such considerations of efficiency; however, while screw propellers offer advantages with regards to mechanical simplicity, they have practical limitations that place upper bounds on their overall hydrodynamic efficiency, such as the limitations of aspect ratio due to cavitation at high tip speeds \citep{Mishima1997, Epps2014}. Promising alternative concepts are {\it cycloidal} and {\it trochoidal propellers}, which can be referred to generally as {\it cross-flow propellers}. The defining feature of a cross-flow propeller is that the axis of rotation is perpendicular to the freestream, as opposed to a screw propeller, whose axis of rotation is roughly aligned with the freestream. The main advantage of cross-flow propellers over conventional screw propellers is their ability to increase frontal area and blade aspect ratio while limiting tip speed and thus cavitation. %Depending on the implementation, cross-flow propellers can also provide thrust-vectoring for high maneuverability.%------------------------------------------------------------------------------The kinematics of a cross-flow propeller are primarily defined by the \emph{absolute advance coefficient}\begin{equation}\lambda \equiv \frac{V_s}{\omega R}\label{eq_lambda}\end{equation}which is ratio of advance speed to rotor tip speed\footnote{See the Nomenclature table for definitions of individual variables.}.  Written another way, $\lambda = ({V_s/n})/({2 \pi R})$ is interpreted as the ratio of rotor \emph{pitch} to circumference.  In nearly all of the propeller literature, including the present article, the term {\it trochoidal propeller} refers specifically to a high-pitch device (designed for $\lambda > 1$), whereas {\it cycloidal propeller} refers to a low-pitch device (designed for $\lambda < 1$). The cross-flow propeller was first implemented as a fixed low-pitch device by \citet{Kirsten1922}. \citet{Schneider1928} improved on Kirsten's design by creating a variable low-pitch device, and he partnered with locksmith Johann Matth\"{a}us Voith to commercialize the Voith-Schneider propeller \citep{Bartels2006,voithURL}. Recent developments include the high-pitch (trochoidal) propeller by  \cite{walvisstaartURL}, as well as a low-pitch cross-flow turbine produced by  \cite{orpcURL}. %------------------------------------------------------------------------------%------------------------------------------------------------------------------{\it Low-pitch (cycloidal) propellers} are used in applications in which both maneuvering and high thrust are design drivers, such as tug boats, river ferries, and minesweepers. \citet{Henry1959} surveyed early work with cycloidal propulsion and laid a foundation for subsequent theoretical analyses and systematic series of experiments. \citet{Taniguchi1955,Taniguchi1962} performed sea trials  and also developed a quasi-steady theoretical model. \citet{Haberman1961} ran computer simulations, and \citet{Haberman1962} completed experiments to test the theories of \citet{Taniguchi1955} and \citet{Isay1956}, respectively. Sparenberg \citep{Sparenberg1960,Sparenberg1968,Sparenberg1969,Sparenberg1975} optimized the motion of a single-foil propeller by minimizing kinetic energy in the wake, resulting in an optimal blade pitch function nearly that of `cycloidal motion'. \citet{vanManen1966} performed experiments to test Sparenberg's optimal motion on multi-bladed propellers, as well as pure cycloidal blade motions, confirming that Sparenberg's optimal motion is effectively identical to cycloidal motion. \citet{James1971} expanded on Sparenberg's optimization work with a more detailed model. The most extensive physical testing to date was performed by \citet{Nakonechny1961,Nakonechny1974}, \citet{Ficken1966}, and \citet{Ficken1969} at the David Taylor Model Basin (DTMB). \citet{Mendenhall1973} created a discrete-wake-vortex model of the cycloidal propeller, comparing results to the DTMB tests. \citet{Zhu1981} furthered the work of Taniguchi with an improved quasi-steady model. %Studies applying cycloidal propulsion to ships and other vehicles have been reported. \citet{Dupuis1993} performed simulations of a minehunter ship outfitted with cycloidal propulsors to determine it's maneuverability characteristics.%Both submersibles \citep{Richards1970,Zhang1998} and inflatable airships \citep{Boschma2001} using cycloidal propulsion systems have also been explored. %------------------------------------------------------------------------------%------------------------------------------------------------------------------{\it High-pitch (trochoidal) propellers} were first proposed by \citet{vanManen1966}. \citet{Dickerson1975} extended the DTMB cycloidal propeller testing to the high-pitch trochoidal propeller case. While the initial testing produced disappointing results, trochoidal propulsion was revived when \citet{Bose1987} adapted a multiple streamtube theory from wind turbine literature \citep{Sharpe1984} predicting efficiencies in excess of 80\%. \citet{Bose1989a} performed experiments to validate the theory. \citet{Veitch1990} furthered Bose's theory by adding blade pitch-rate effects, and performed experiments covering a wider range of operating conditions. \citet{Li1991} and \citet{Riijarvi1994} extended Mendenhall and Spangler's discrete vortex model by relaxing the Kutta condition and including a dynamic stall hysteresis effect, and they compared their results to their own experiments. \citet{Brockett1991} attempted to simplify earlier models and presented simulation results for various pitch functions. \citet{vanManen1996} further simplified Brockett's model to explore the upper limits of efficiency using Sparenberg's optimal blade pitch function. More recently, commercial software was used to run Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) simulations \citep{Jurgens2007,Hwang2008,Esmailian2014}.  %------------------------------------------------------------------------------{\it Limits to previous work:}  %------------------------------------------------------------------------------Despite all of the advances made in the study of cross-flow propulsion systems, there remain avenues to be explored. %fundamentally undermining the proposal that high efficiency can be achieved with high capture areaEarly theoretical models made aggressive assumptions regarding velocities induced by the shed wake vortices, leading to inaccurate models. Most theoretical models were also developed in 2D, assuming elliptical span-wise blade loading. Laboratory experiments, however, often used blades with small aspect ratios ($\AR = b^2/S \le 5$), leading to poor agreement with theory. Experiments have also been plagued by high friction in pitch control devices, causing noisy data and inconsistent results. Another common feature of laboratory experiments is a prescribed cycloidal blade pitch function. Although \citet{Bose1987} showed that efficiency of sinusoidal pitch motion was always less than that of cycloidal pitch motion, his model was shown to greatly under-predict experimental data \citep{Riijarvi1994}. These pitch motions are explained in detail in \S\ref{sec:beta}, specifically equations~\eqref{eq:sinusoidal} and~\eqref{eq:amp_cyc}. \citet{Mueller1955} performed river testing on tugboats to compare cycloidal and sinusoidal motion. He reports ``sinusoidal blade motion is considerably less efficient; however, this is compensated for by a simpler mechanism, fewer parts, less frictional losses and a more rugged construction''.  \citet{Nakonechny1961} performed an experiment with a ``modified sinusoidal motion'' which was more efficient than the cycloidal motion with the same maximum pitch angle, but only had an efficiency of 41\%. Micro air vehicles have also been designed using sinusoidal blade pitch functions \citep{Wheatley1935,Gibbens1999,Parsons2005,Sirohi2007,Tanaka2007,Benedict2010a,Benedict2010b}, but the focus in this body of literature is on hovering performance rather than forward flight propulsion.  In summary, this extensive literature review reveals that there is a lack of rigorous, scale-model testing of a trochoidal propeller employing sinusoidal blades pitch motions.  In addition,  the literature has not yet converged upon a theoretical model that accurately predicts trochoidal propeller performance.%------------------------------------------------------------------------------{\it Contributions of the present work:}%------------------------------------------------------------------------------In response to the shortcomings of previous experimental work, we conducted a series of towing tank experiments with a model-scale trochoidal propeller. The propeller uses a sinusoidal blade pitch function, which has not yet been tested  in a controlled laboratory setting. We also use higher aspect ratio blades than many previous experiments. The main results presented herein are the performance curves of thrust and torque coefficients as functions of the absolute advance coefficient. Propulsive efficiency is derived from these data. We compare our results with those of both high-pitch and low-pitch cycloidal-pitch-function propellers, as well as standard screw propellers.%In addition to experimental results, we have also created a theoretical model that applies to both low- and high-pitch cross-flow propulsors. The goal of our computational work is to enable rapid optimization of a cross-flow propeller given design constraints \citep{Roesler2014OMAEproc}. The present theoretical model is a 2D potential flow model that is based on the free wake model presented by \citet{Mendenhall1973}. The present model extends beyond the prior work of \citet{Brockett1991,vanManen1966}, and others by combining several features, notably: 3D correction for a rectangular planform wing, force due to flow-field curvature, and unsteady lift and drag forces. A novel contribution of the present model is the use of leading edge vortex shedding, in addition to trailing edge vortex shedding, to more accurately model stall. The theoretical model is further described in \S\ref{sec:cyrod} and \cite{CyROD1.16theorydoc}.%%------------------------------------------------------------------------------%\paragraph{Organization of this article:}%%------------------------------------------------------------------------------%In \S\ref{sec_experiment}, the experimental design and measurement techniques employed herein are described.  In \S\ref{app:cyrod}, the theoretical model is detailed. In \S\ref{sec:results}, we present our experimental results with comparison to our theoretical model performance predictions. %  Additional validation of theoretical model predictions versus prior published data is presented in Appendix~\ref{app:validation}.

Figure~\ref{fig:sw_3dmodel} is a CAD drawing of the experimental apparatus. The apparatus consists of four main components: (\emph{i}) the rotor and blades; (\emph{ii}) the blade pitch control mechanism; (\emph{iii}) an inner frame to support the rotor, driveshaft, and crankshaft; and (\emph{iv}) an outer frame to interface with the towing carriage and to enable force measurement. The inner frame is mounted on bearing rails and attached to the outer frame through two load cells, which measure the thrust and side force.  Shaft torque is measured via a torque transducer on each of the driveshaft and the crankshaft.% Entire model isometric view\begin{figure}[tbh]  \centering  \includegraphics[width=0.8\columnwidth]{Fig1_fullframe.pdf}  \caption{CAD rendering of the trochoidal propeller and measurement apparatus. The thrust load cell is located in a similar position to the side force load cell, on the back of the device (not visible in this view).}  \label{fig:sw_3dmodel}\end{figure}Towing tank experiments were conducted at the Jere A.\ Chase Ocean Engineering Laboratory at the University of New Hampshire (UNH). A total of 21 combinations of carriage speed and propeller RPM were performed three times each, for a total of 63 data points. The entire experimental apparatus is shown mounted in the UNH towing tank in Figure~\ref{fig:towtankphotos}. The height of the machine was adjusted such that the blades terminated just below the water surface, and only the blade spindles pierced the water surface.  Since these shafts were of small diameter and the experiments were run at low speed, wave making was minimal during the experiments.\begin{figure*}[thb!]\centering\mbox{\resizebox{!}{2.75 in}{\includegraphics{Fig2a_carriage.jpg}}}\mbox{\resizebox{!}{2.75 in}{\includegraphics{Fig2b_propeller.jpg}}} \caption{Photos of the testing apparatus mounted on the tow carriage at the UNH testing facility. The hydrofoils appear shorter than the CAD rendering in Figure~\ref{fig:sw_3dmodel} due to the index of refraction of water.}\label{fig:towtankphotos}\end{figure*}\subsection{Rotor and Blade Design}The propeller design specifications are summarized as follows: blade number $Z = 4$,  rotor diameter $D = 0.3175$ m, chord $c=0.15$ m, and span $b = 0.75$ m.  Four blades were chosen for mechanical symmetry, and rotor diameter was maximized given the constraints of the tow tank facility. Foil span was chosen to maximize blade aspect ratio, subject to stiffness constraints. This design yields non-dimensional measurements of $c/D = 0.47$, $b/D = 2.36$, aspect ratio $\AR \equiv b^2/A_p = 5$, and solidity $\sigma \equiv Zc/(\pi D) = 0.602$.  For the rectangular planform used herein, the blade planform area is $A_p=bc$. The blades were designed to balance tradeoffs in performance, stiffness, maximum loads, and Reynolds number, as well as to provide a simple geometry amenable for comparison to computer models.  Thus, the selected geometry was a rectangular planform with thickness varying linearly along the span. The section geometry was chosen to be a symmetric NACA 0015 at the root, linearly tapering to a NACA 0008 at the tip.  Each blade was CNC milled from hardwood in two pieces (\ie the chord line formed a parting line for the two halves).  The blade halves were glued together around a steel rod and then epoxy coated.  The steel rod was embedded in the blade to increase stiffness and to provide a location on which to weld the blade spindle shafts. The spindles were placed at the quarter chord, which is the theoretical center of pressure for a symmetric airfoil section.The chord length was sized to ensure that the Reynolds number, $\mathit{Re} = \sqrt{V_s^2 + (\omega R)^2}\, c/\nu$, would always exceed $10^5$ in the experiments.  Testing carriage speeds ranged from 0.5\,\textendash\,1.5 m/s and rotation speeds ranged from 24\,\textendash\,45 RPM, giving Reynolds numbers in the range $1.0 \times 10^5 \leq \mathit{Re} \leq 2.5  \times 10^5$.  At these Reynolds numbers, the boundary layer can reasonably be expected to transition to turbulence rather than experience laminar flow separation.   Analysis of a NACA 0015 section at $\mathit{Re} = 1.0  \times 10^5$ and $\alpha = 0$ (using the open-source software XFOIL~\citep{Drela1989}) shows that natural transition occurs at $x_{tr} = 0.885c$; however, for a NACA 0008 section at $\alpha = 0^\circ$, natural transition does not occur for any $1.0 \times 10^5 \leq \mathit{Re} \leq 2.5  \times 10^5$.  At $\mathit{Re} = 1.0  \times 10^5$ and say, $\alpha = 5^\circ$, the NACA 0015 and 0008 sections experience natural transition on the suction side at $x_{tr} = 0.42c$ and $0.11c$, respectively.  In general, larger angles of attack and rough blade surfaces trigger turbulence earlier (\ie smaller $x_{tr}$).  Therefore, it is expected that the flow will be transitional or turbulent for most of the blade during most of the experiments.  At the experimental Reynolds numbers, the flow is expected to be representative of higher-Reynolds-number flows of a full-scale ship propeller.  %==============================================================================\subsection{Blade Pitch Control}\label{sec:beta}	For a given advance coefficient $\lambda$, the kinematics of a cross-flow propeller are defined by the {blade pitch angle}, $\beta$, as a function of orbit angle, $\phi$, as illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:angleslabel}. Of the vast array cross-flow propeller design parameters, $\bp$ is the most influential to performance, since it ultimately dictates the angle of attack, $\alpha$, and thus the resulting loads. \begin{figure}[h!]  \centering		\includegraphics[width=0.75\columnwidth]{Fig3_angles_v2.pdf}		\caption{Blade angle definitions. View in the $\yhat$ direction (up from below). The blade pitch angle $\beta$ is defined relative to the tangent, while $\beta_{abs}$ is defined relative to the horizontal.  Note: $\beta$ is negative as shown, whereas all other angles are positive as shown.}		\label{fig:angleslabel}\end{figure}The two most common classes of $\bp$ functions are listed below.  Other classes of $\bp$ functions can theoretically be formed using a Fourier series, any other series of orthogonal basis functions, or using B-spline basis functions.\begin{enumerate}\item \emph{Sinusoidal} (given amplitude $a$ and phase $\phi_p$)    \begin{align}    \text{For $\lambda < 1$:} &&  \beta &=                -  a \sin(\phi + \phi_p)    \nonumber \\    \text{For $\lambda > 1$:} &&  \beta_{abs} &=  \phantom{-}a \sin(\phi + \phi_p)  \label{eq:sinusoidal}     \end{align}\item \emph{Cycloidal} (given amplitude $a$ and eccentricity $e$)    \begin{equation} \label{eq:amp_cyc}    \beta = -a \cdot \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{e \sin \phi}{1 + e \cos \phi}\right)    \end{equation}\end{enumerate}Conversion between relative and absolute pitch angle is $\beta~=~\beta_{abs} - \phi$ and$\beta_{abs}~=~\beta + \phi$, where the left-hand side of each equation is shifted by $\pm2\pi$ if necessary to ensure that is lies within the range $\[-\pi,\pi\]$.In order to test arbitrary pitch functions $\beta(\phi)$, we designed a system of concentric collars (one for each blade), that can be oscillated independently of each other, as well as the driveshaft \citep{Roesler2014patent}. For this experiment, we implemented a sinusoidal pitch function \eqref{eq:sinusoidal}with $a = 20^\circ$ and $\phi_p =0$, due to mechanical simplicity and the lack of prior published literature considering sinusoidal pitch motions. Figure~\ref{fig:crankshaft} shows a CAD rendering of the pitch control mechanism designed for this experiment.  The crankshaft is driven by a sprocket connected with a chain to an equal-sized gear on the driveshaft, such that the driveshaft and crankshaft rotate at the same speed, $\omega$.  This sprocket is visible on the top of the crankshaft in Figure~\ref{fig:sw_3dmodel}, but the chain is not shown.  The crankshaft drives  a four-bar linkage to oscillate a set of concentric collars. These collars are connected via gear-chain-sprocket to the blade spindle shafts (which rotate with speed $\dot\beta_{abs} = a \cos(\phi + \phi_p)$ for the sinusoidal motion implemented herein).% Crankshaft image\begin{figure}[h!]      \centering      \includegraphics[width=0.8\columnwidth]{Fig4a_pitchcontrol_full.pdf}      \includegraphics[width=0.8\columnwidth]{Fig4b_pitchcontrol_cut.pdf}      \caption{CAD rendering of the pitch control mechanism, showing the crankshaft, four-bar linkage, set of concentric collars, chains, sprockets, and blade spindle shafts. The crankshaft is coupled to the driveshaft with a 1:1 gear ratio, such that both rotate with speed $\omega$.  Each concentric collar is coupled to a blade spindle with a 1:1 gear ratio. The concentric collars employ a stacked ``middle-out'' design, which allows the crankshaft to rotate each foil independently of the rotor shaft to achieve the desired $\beta_{abs}$.}  \label{fig:crankshaft}\end{figure}  %==============================================================================\subsection{Load Measurement} % \label{sec:loadmeas}The hydrodynamic forces acting on the blades give rise to a total force acting on the rotor, which has components in the thrust ($-\xhat$) and side force ($\zhat$) directions.  The rotor was part of an {\it inner frame} assembly, which was mounted on perpendicular rails using Thomson 411N15G0 linear bearings.  The inner frame assembly is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:powerflow}, and the {\it outer frame} and rails are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:sw_3dmodel}. The outer frame was fixed to the towing carriage, and the inner frame was free to slide along the bearing rails.  In Figure~\ref{fig:sw_3dmodel}, the purple bearing stage moves in the $\pm\zhat$ directions, and the green bearing stage moves in the $\pm\xhat$ directions. Two Omega LC402-100 load cells constrained this motion by applying (and thus measuring) the requisite thrust and side forces.  The propeller was powered by a NEMA-56 1hp 90VDC electric motor. To increase the accuracy of the load measurements, the motor was mounted to the outer frame, and the motor output shaft was coupled to the driveshaft torque sensor input shaft using a Curtis double universal joint, which  freely allowed translation of the inner frame along the rails. Both the inner and outer frames were constructed of 80/20 aluminum framing.The load cells were calibrated by applying known loads to the driveshaft at the level of the rotor. Loads were applied in the $\pm\xhat$ and $\pm\zhat$ directions, as well as at $45\deg$ angles to each axis. The load cells were rated to $\pm1$ lb (0.45 kg) precision, which provided a measurement uncertainty less than 10\% of the expected loads of 50 kg and larger. Following calibration, further known-load testing confirmed that force measurements were accurate to within 1\% of the expected values. Cross-talk between the $-\xhat$ and $\zhat$ direction force sensors was negligible. The hydrodynamic loads also give rise to a net moment (in the $\yhat$ direction) about the driveshaft as well as moments about each of the blade spindles.  This apparatus was designed to infer the rotor torque $Q$ as well as the total spindle torque $S$.  Two torque sensors were used: a Himmelstein 24-02T(1-3) rotary torque transducer for the driveshaft, and a Futek TRS300 rotary torque transducer for the crankshaft.  Force and torque data were preprocessed by a strain gauge conditioner and amplifier system before being read by Vernier LabQuest units into Vernier LoggerPro software. Further processing was performed in \Matlab to remove baseline friction torque measurements. Figure~\ref{fig:powerflow} is a schematic of the power flow through the device, which illustrates the torque measurements $Q^*$ and $S^*$, friction power losses $P_{fd}$ and $P_{fc}$, and the data processing used to infer the hydrodynamic torques $Q$ and $S$.  The motor delivered input power $P_{in} = Q^*\omega$, where $Q^*$ is measured on the input shaft. Some of this input power is delivered to the crankshaft, and the remaining to the driveshaft: $P_{in} = P_c + P_d$.  The crankshaft power is $P_c = S^*\w$, where $S^*$ is measured on the crankshaft, and thus, the driveshaft power is $P_d = (Q^*-S^*)\omega$.  The hydrodynamic rotor power is the driveshaft power less that lost due to friction in the concentric collar sub-assembly: $P_r = P_d - P_{fd} = Q\omega$.  Similarly, the hydrodynamic power needed to pivot the blades is $P_s = P_c - P_{fc} = S\omega$.  Thus, the spindle torque $S$ is the average over the $Z$ blades, $S = \frac{1}{\omega} \sum\limits_{i=1}^Z Q_{s_i} \dot\beta_i$, where $Q_{s_i}$ is the spindle torque on blade $i$.To characterize friction losses $P_{fd}$ and $P_{fc}$, the propeller was run in air without foils attached to simulate $P_r = P_s = 0$. In this case, the friction losses are given in terms of the measured quantities:   $P_{fc} = P_c = S^*\w$ and $P_{fd} = P_{in} - P_c = (Q^* - S^*)\w$. These friction losses were measured over a range of rotation speeds, so the losses could be removed from the torque data measured during the towing tank experiments.% Power flow \begin{figure}[h!]  \centering\includegraphics[width=0.7\columnwidth]{Fig5_innerframe.pdf}\caption{CAD rendering of the inner frame assembly (everything below the universal joint).

The model is described at length by \cite{Roesler2014OMAEproc}, so only the salient details are repeated herein.  Modifications to the model since that publication are also described as follows.Our model is based upon 2D potential flow but includes corrections for both 3D and viscous effects.  Specifically, we employ a vortex lattice formulation with a free-wake model, with shed vorticity advected with the freestream plus induced velocity field.Although the simulation assumes constant ship speed $V_s$ and rotation speed $\omega$, the simulation is unsteady since the blade pitch angle $\beta$ varies with orbit angle $\phi$. The general solution scheme assumes that the rotor has reached a limit cycle, such that the circulations of the bound and free vortices are periodic with respect to $\phi$.  The model accounts for six load effects: steady lift, steady drag, lift due to flow curvature, unsteady lift, added mass, and acceleration reaction.  Figure~\ref{fig:WAKE} illustrates the free wake model. The bound and wake vortices are illustrated as points, with blue indicating counterclockwise circulation and red indicating clockwise circulation. The induced velocity field is shown as vector arrows. We have coded this model in a software suite called \CR (Cycloidal Rotor Optimization and Design).  \CRV is used for all  computations herein.  Further information regarding the numerical implementation is given in \citep{CyROD1.16theorydoc}.%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%\subsection{Solution of the Boundary Value Problem}\label{sec:BVP}The fundamental formulation is a boundary value problem to determine the bound vortex strength $\Gamma_b$ such that the normal component (through the blade) of the bound-vortex-induced velocity is equal and opposite to the normal component of the blade-motion plus wake-induced velocity. This boundary value equation is implicitly solved at a control point on the key blade in the formulation that follows. The primary unknowns in the simulation are the relative velocity $\vec{V}_r$,  angle of attack $\alfa$,lift coefficient $C_L(\alpha)$,bound vortex strength $\Gamma_b$, wake vortex strength $\Gamma_w$,wake vortex position $\vec{r}_w$, and theinduced velocity $\vec{U}^*$,  which all vary with time (\ie blade orbit angle) in the simulation.  The inclusion of foil-foil and foil-wake interactions (through the induced velocity field) makes the solution non-linear. The quantities $\vec{V_r}$, $\alfa$, $C_L$, $\Gamma_b$, $\Gamma_w$, $\vec{r}_w$, and $\vec{U}^*$  are circularly dependent, so an iterative procedure is employed in order to converge on a solution for which these parameters are consistent. The loads can then be calculated using the converged values. %--------------------------------------------------------------------------\begin{figure*}[htb!]\centering\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{Fig6_animationframe.pdf}\caption{Illustration of the free wake model. Flow separation can be seen in the bottom right foils. The wake- and bound-vortex-induced velocity vectors, excluding the uniform freestream, are also shown. Blue vortices represent counterclockwise ($-\yhat$) circulation, and red vortices represent clockwise ($+\yhat$) circulation. Bound vortex and wake vortex strength are scaled separately, for clarity. The wake vortices are generally significantly less strong than the bound vortices.}\label{fig:WAKE}\end{figure*}The total velocity relative to the control point on the key blade is $\vec V_r = \vec{U}^* - \vec u_c$, which includes the absolute motion of the control point  $\vec u_c$ and the velocity $\vec{U}^*$ induced at the control point by the other blades as well as the wakes of all blades.  The relative velocity $\vec{V}_r$ is illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:angleslabel}, along with the resulting angle of attack $\alpha$, which is used to compute the lift and drag coefficients.%The lift and drag coefficients ($C_L(\alpha)$ and $C_D(\alpha)$) are modeled using the analytic formulae from \citep{Epps2013b,Epps2013a}. For angles of attack less than the stall angle (\ie attached flow): \begin{align}  C_L(\alpha) &\approx  C_{L_0} + \frac{dC_L}{d\alpha} (\alpha - \alpha_0) \label{eq:CL} \\C_D(\alpha) &\approx C_{D_0} \label{eq:CD} \end{align}These equations allow specification of the lift curve slope  $dC_L/d\alfa$ to account for the finite aspect ratio of the blades, with $dC_L/d\alfa$ given by Figure 12.16 in \citep{Katz2001} for a rectangular planform wing. Because a symmetrical foil is chosen herein, $C_{L_0} = 0$. The initial drag coefficient $C_{D_0}$ is chosen to be 0.02 \citep{Katz2001}. Post stall, $C_L(\alpha)$ is approximately constant, and $C_D(\alpha)$ rises to the canonical value of 2 when the inflow is normal to the blade. The model also includes the {lift-induced drag}, such that the total drag coefficient is $C_{D,total} = C_D(\alpha) + {C_L(\alpha)^2}/{\pi \AR \, e_o}$,  where $e_o = 0.9$ is Oswald's efficiency factor \citep{Oswald1933}.Blade stall is taken into account both in $C_L(\alpha)$ itself and by shedding vorticity both from the trailing edge and from a chordwise position nearer to the leading edge, depending on the depth of stall \citep{Katz1981}. The wake then consists of discrete vortices, which advect with the total velocity field, including both the uniform freestream and the wake- and bound-vortex-induced velocities.  Combining the Kutta-Joukowski theorem with the definition of the lift coefficient, the {bound circulation} about the foil is: \begin{equation}\GB = \half V_r C_L c \label{eq_Gb}\end{equation}Equations \eqref{eq_Gb} and \eqref{eq:CL} implicitly solve the boundary value problem, setting the lift coefficient and bound vortex circulation such that the no-through-flow boundary condition is satisfied.The circulation of the vortex (possibly) shed due to separated-flow $\GS$ is given by equations 31 and 32 in \citep{Katz1981}.The circulation of the vortex shed at the trailing edge is then determined by Kelvin's theorem applied between times $t_{i-1}$ and $t_i$ in the simulation: $\GW\i = \GB\imo - \GB\i - \GS\i$.The induced velocities are computed using the Biot-Savart law, modified to include a viscous vortex core radius $\epsilon$ as in \citep{Drela1999_asw_aiaa}.    The vortex core radius $\epsilon$ desingularizes the induced velocity and represents the viscous effects in the vortex core.%--------------------------------------------------------------------------\subsection{Loads}We model the following forces and moments (per unit span): \begin{align}\vec{f}_{SL} &= \half \rho V_r^2  \, C_L \, c \: (\vec{\hat{V}}_r \times \yhat)		&& \text{(quasi-steady lift)}  \label{eq:lift} \\\vec{f}_{SD} &= \half \rho V_r^2  \, C_D \, c \: (\vec{\hat{V}}_r )                 && \text{(quasi-steady drag)}  \label{eq:drag} \\\vec{f}_{UL} &=  \rho \frac{d\Gamma_b}{dt}  c \: (\vec{\hat{V}}_r \times \yhat)     && \text{(unsteady lift)}  \label{eq:ulift} \\\vec{f}_{FC} &= \half \rho V_r^2 \, C_L^*\, c \: (\vec{\hat{V}}_r \times \yhat)		&& \text{(lift from flow curvature)}  \label{eq:lift_curve}  \\\vec{f}_{AC} &= -\mu \vec a_a 		  												&& \text{(acceleration reaction)}  \\\vec{m}_{AC} &= -J  (-\ddot\beta_{abs} \yhat ) 										&& \text{(acceleration reaction)}  \\			 & F_1, F_2, \text{ and } M_3 											&& \text{(added mass loads)} \end{align}where $\displaystyle \vec{\hat{V}}_r = {\vec{V}_r}/{|\vec{V}_r|}$ is the unit vector in the relative inflow direction,  $\mu$ is blade mass per unit length,  $J$ is the blade rotational moment of inertia about the pitching axis (per unit length), and $\vec a_a$ is the acceleration of the center of mass.  $C_L^*$ is the lift coefficient due to flow curvature \citep{Migliore1980}, calculated as follows. Given the velocity $\vec V_q$ and acceleration $\vec a_q$ of the quarter chord point, the effective radius of curvature of the flow is\begin{equation}R_{c} = {|\vec V_{q}|^3}/{|\vec V_{q} \times \vec a_{q}|}.  \end{equation}The camber $f_0$ of a circular arc meanline is related to $R_c$ via\begin{equation}\label{eq:f0oc}\frac{f_0}{c} = \frac{R_{c}}{c} - \left[ \left(\frac{R_{c}}{c}\right)^2 -  \frac{1}{4} \right]^{\frac{1}{2}}\end{equation}For small camber ratios, the lift coefficients of a parabolic arc and a circular arc are nearly identical \citep{Thiart2005}, so we use the lift coefficient for a parabolic arc meanline\begin{equation}C_L^* = 4\pi\frac{f_0}{c}\end{equation}The sign of $C_L^*$ is such that $\vec{f}_{FC}$ points in the direction of $\vec{a}_q$. Equations \eqref{eq:lift} and \eqref{eq_Gb} embody the steady form of the Kutta--Joukowski theorem, and equation \eqref{eq:ulift} is the unsteady form of the Kutta-Joukowski theorem \citep{Drela1999_asw_aiaa}.The added mass forces and moment are computed in blade-fixed coordinates $(1,2,3)$; the blade section is modeled as a 2D ellipse, with added mass coefficients $m_{11} = \frac{1}{4}\pi\rho t_0^2$, $m_{22} = \frac{1}{4}\pi\rho c^2$, and $m_{66} = \frac{1}{32}\pi\rho(c^2 - t_0^2)^2$ as given in \citep{Newman1977}, where $t_0$ is the maximum section thickness.   The acceleration reaction moment includes a double negative, since it is the reaction to the acceleration, but $\beta_{abs}$ is defined positive in the $-\yhat$ direction.The quasi-steady lift force, quasi-steady drag force, lift modification due to flow curvature, and unsteady lift force are all assumed to act at the aerodynamic center of pressure (which is the quarter-chord point for a symmetric airfoil). The hydrodynamic added mass loads are assumed to act at the mid-chord. The acceleration reaction loads are assumed to act at the center of mass (centroid of area). Since the foil is assumed to be symmetric, there is no moment about the center of pressure associated with the lift and drag forces.These forces are summed to give the total force acting on the rotor, the $-\xhat$ and $\zhat$ components of which are the thrust $T$ and side force $F$, respectively. Similarly, the moments produced by these forces are summed about the $\yhat$ axis (rotor driveshaft) to give the rotor torque $Q$, and summed about the foil spindle axes to give torques $Q_s$.  The power-averaged spindle torque is \begin{equation}S = \frac{1}{\omega} \sum\limits_{i=1}^Z Q_{s_i} \dot\beta_i\end{equation}such that the total hydrodynamic power is $(Q+S)\omega$. In general, we expect $Q \gg S$.%--------------------------------------------------------------------------% \clearpage%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%\section{Experimental Results and Discussion} \label{sec:results}The main results presented herein are measurements of thrust and torque for a trochoidal propeller with four blades using a sinusoidal blade pitch function. We also report the derived quantity, efficiency. We present the measurements as non-dimensional coefficients:\begin{align}   C_T &= \frac{\langle T \rangle}{\half\rho V_s^2 A} 	&&\text{thrust coefficient}			\label{eq:cta} \\  C_Q &= \frac{\langle Q \rangle}{\half\rho V_s^2 A R}	&&\text{rotor torque coefficient}	 	\label{eq:cqa}   \\  C_S &= \frac{\langle S \rangle}{\half\rho V_s^2 A R}	&&\text{spindle torque coefficient} 	\label{eq:csa}\end{align}where the $\langle \; \rangle$ represent time-averaged values over an integer number of rotor cycles.Time-averaged thrust and power input are combined to calculate the hydrodynamic efficiency of the propeller \begin{equation} \label{eq:eta}  \eta  = \frac{\langle T \rangle V_s}{\langle Q+S \rangle \omega} = \frac{C_T}{C_Q + C_S} \lambda\end{equation}These results are presented in Figure~\ref{fig:expdata} and~\ref{fig:w2015ETA} as functions of the absolute advance coefficient $\lambda$. Data points taken at the same carriage speed are connected with solid black lines to give a sense of Reynolds number dependence. Inspection of these point groupings shows that Reynolds independence has been achieved in these experiments. The thick, red dashed line in each figure is a third-order polynomial fit to the experimental data. The thin, red dashed lines are the 95\% confidence functional bounds (computed in \textsc{Matlab} using \texttt{polyconf} with the options \code{simopt} = \code{off} and \code{predopt} = \code{curve}). These curves represent the uncertainty of the location of the fitted curve, given the finite number of data points and the spread in the data.  Our theoretical model performance predictions are shown by a solid blue curve in all figures.  Figures~\ref{fig:expdata} and \ref{fig:w2015ETA} show excellent agreement between the theoretical model predictions and the experimental data. The thrust coefficient prediction shown in Figure~\ref{fig:w2015CTA} parallels the lower 95\% confidence bound for nearly the entire range of $\lambda$ values, showing excellent agreement with the shape of the $C_T(\lambda)$ curve. The torque coefficient data shown in Figure~\ref{fig:w2015CQA} show remarkably low noise levels across the range of $\lambda$ values tested, as compared to torque coefficient data from a similar trochoidal propeller presented in \citep{Bose1989a}. Although the theoretical model prediction for $C_Q$ falls just below the 95\% confidence bound, the curve matches the shape of the data well, showing that the prediction is off by a nearly-constant offset. This offset may be explained by the fact that baseline friction measurements %(detailed in \S\ref{sec:loadmeas}) were made prior to the test runs. Frictional losses decrease as the machine runs for a longer time, so the measured friction losses may be higher than that actual frictional losses experienced during test runs, causing the corrected $C_Q$ values to be slightly higher than the theoretical prediction. The theoretical prediction of the crankshaft torque $C_S$ agrees exceedingly well for all $\lambda$ values.\begin{figure*}[h!t]  \centering  % CTA vs lambda    \begin{subfigure}[t]{0.9\columnwidth}      \centering      \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{Fig7a_CT.pdf}      \caption{Thrust coefficient $C_T$ versus $\lambda$.}      \label{fig:w2015CTA}    \end{subfigure}    \hspace{0.05\columnwidth}    % CQA vs lambda    \begin{subfigure}[t]{0.9\columnwidth}      \centering      \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{Fig7b_CQ_CS.pdf}      \caption{Driveshaft torque $C_Q$ and spindle torque $C_S$ versus $\lambda$. }      \label{fig:w2015CQA}    \end{subfigure}    \hspace{0.05\columnwidth}  % CQA+CSA vs lambda    \begin{subfigure}[t]{0.9\columnwidth}      \centering      \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{Fig7c_CQS.pdf}      \caption{Total torque $C_Q + C_S$ versus $\lambda$.}      \label{fig:w2015CQSA}    \end{subfigure}    \hspace{0.05\columnwidth}  % ETA vs lambda figure    \begin{subfigure}[t]{0.9\columnwidth}      \centering      \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{Fig7d_ETA.pdf}      \caption{Hydrodynamic efficiency $\eta$ versus $\lambda$.}      \label{fig:w2015ETA}    \end{subfigure}\caption{Experimental data from our trochoidal propeller with $Z = 4$ and sinusoidal blade pitch function $\beta_{abs}(\phi) = 20\deg \sin\phi$.

More importantly, the prediction nearly matches the fit curve near the $\lambda$ values corresponding to values of peak $\eta$, which are of greatest interest. Because $\eta$ is a derived quantity, there is more scatter in the efficiency data than for the directly-measured force and torque data. The carriage tow speed $V_s$ and motor rotational speed $\w$ are more precisely known than the thrust and torque, so scatter in the efficiency data are attributed to errors in thrust and torque measurement. In particular, the total torque coefficient $C_Q+C_S$ is in the denominator of $\eta$  \eqref{eq:eta}, so small~measurement~error in torque is amplified in efficiency.  In our experiment, efficiencies were measured as high as $\eta = 86.7\%$, and the peak efficiency of the fitted curve was $\eta = 70.0\%$.  The peak efficiency predicted by our theoretical model is $70.3\%$, in good agreement with the fitted data.  Comparing to prior studies, the efficiency of our propeller ($Z=4$, $\beta_{abs} = 20\deg \sin\phi$) was slightly lower than the propellers of both \citet{Haberman1961} (whose cycloidal propeller with $Z=6$ had a maximum efficiency $\eta = 76\%$) and \citet{Bose1989a} (whose trochoidal propeller with $Z=3$ achieved a peak $\eta = 82\%$). For reference, we can also compare these values to those of commonly used screw propellers, such as David Taylor Model Basin (DTMB) propeller 4381, which achieves a maximum efficiency of $\eta = 75\%$ \citep{Hecker1971}.Figure~\ref{fig:ETAvsCTA} compares the efficiency of these propellers to the ideal efficiency $\eta_i$, which is the theoretical upper limit set by actuator disk theory\begin{equation}   \eta_i = \frac{2}{1 + \sqrt{1 + C_T}}   \label{eq:etai}\end{equation}Note that several of the efficiency curves parallel $\eta_i$ for $C_T$ greater than about 0.3. The main argument for choosing a cross-flow propeller instead of a conventional screw propeller is optimal use of package space under a ship, which may result in higher propulsive efficiency. Since $\eta_i$ increases with increasing frontal area $A$ (for a given thrust), it follows that a propulsor which covers the maximum amount of available area has the highest ideal efficiency. To take advantage of the rectangular package space defined by the beam and draft of a ship, a cross-flow propeller sweeps out a rectangular area, as opposed to the circular area swept out by a screw propeller. Figure~\ref{fig:configurations} shows two possible configurations of a cross-flow propeller, horizontal and vertical, illustrating the larger area swept out by the cross-flow propeller for a given package space. Thus, for the same available package space and the same thrust requirement, a cross-flow propeller has a higher ideal efficiency than a screw propeller.  For example, consider a ship outfitted with screw propeller 4381 and requiring $C_T = 1.5$; the efficiency is roughly 61\%.  If the same ship were outfitted with the present cross-flow propeller capturing three times the frontal area, then $C_T = 0.5$, resulting in an efficiency of roughly 66\%, a 5 percentage-point efficiency gain.  The other functional argument for using a cross-flow propeller is that it affords the possibility of a vertical-axis configuration for thrust vectoring, also shown in Figure~\ref{fig:configurations}. % Rotor configurations figure\begin{figure}[htb]	\centering	\begin{subfigure}[b]{0.9\columnwidth}		\centering		\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{rotor_horizontal_cropped.eps}		\caption{Horizontal-axis configuration.

The first note is the exceptionally high efficiency of the trochoidal propeller in experiments performed by \citep{Bose1989a}.  Making an argument along the lines of above, if the package space could be tuned such that $0.08 < C_T < 0.13$, then the \citep{Bose1989a} propeller offers higher efficiencies than the peak value from any of the other propellers; however, for $C_T > 0.16$, the efficiency of the \citep{Bose1989a} propeller is less than DTMB 4381.The shape of our experimental $\eta(C_T)$ curve is also quite interesting. Although our propeller is high-pitch sinusoidal-$\beta$, our $\eta(C_T)$ curve more closely matches that of the low-pitch cycloidal-$\beta$ in \citep{Haberman1961} rather than that of the high-pitch cycloidal-$\beta$ propeller in \citep{Bose1989a}. This one example shows that a high-pitch propeller using a sinusoidal $\beta$ can maintain a much higher efficiency as $C_T$ increases than a high-pitch propeller using a cycloidal $\beta$. The practical implication of this result is that a high-pitch sinusoidal-$\beta$ propeller is more versatile than a  high-pitch cycloidal-$\beta$ propeller because it maintains higher levels of efficiency in high thrust situations, such as maneuvering or station-keeping. This result also refutes the theoretical results of \citet{Bose1987}, whose multiple streamtube model predicted that a cycloidal $\beta$ function would outperform a sinusoidal $\beta$ function in all cases. Because our vortex-lattice theoretical model matches so well to experimental results, we can conclude that simple momentum models such as those used by \citet{Bose1987}, \citet{Brockett1991}, and \citet{vanManen1996} do not accurately capture the physics of cross-flow propellers, and therefore produce unrealistic performance predictions. Figure~\ref{fig:ETAvsCTA} also shows that the upper 95\% confidence bound of our experimental data is less than the efficiency reported by  \citet{Haberman1961} for a low-pitch cycloidal-$\beta$ propeller and also less than the efficiency of DTMB screw propeller 4381.  This result is confirmed by our theoretical model prediction, giving a high level of confidence that the high-pitch sinusoidal-$\beta$ propeller is always less efficient than the low-pitch cycloidal-$\beta$  propeller.  Moreover, in the preliminary design of this experiment, the theoretical model was used to evaluate the peak efficiency achieved by  sinusoidal-pitch propellers ($\beta_{abs} = a \sin(\phi + \phi_p)$) over a range of amplitudes $10\deg < a < 40\deg$ and phase offsets $-15\deg < \phi_p < 15\deg$; the combination of $a=20\deg$ and $\phi_p=0\deg$ yielded one of the highest peak efficiencies.  Therefore, our model and the data in Figure~\ref{fig:ETAvsCTA} indicate that a high-pitch sinusoidal-$\beta$ propeller nearly always performs worse than a low-pitch cycloidal-$\beta$ propeller.  %A detailed design example performed by \cite{Roesler2014OMAEproc} compares a traditional screw propeller design with a cross-flow propeller design, each optimized for a given ship geometry, and again shows that the screw propeller out-performs the present cross-flow propeller. Given that our propeller is of similar mechanical complexity to a low-pitch cycloidal-$\beta$ propeller, there is no practical advantage to using our propeller. % ETA vs CTA Figure\begin{figure}[t!]  \centering  \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{Fig8_ETAvsCT.pdf}  \caption{Hydrodynamic efficiency $\eta$ versus $C_T$, with comparison to actuator disk theory $\eta_i$, as defined in equation \eqref{eq:etai}.

For comparison, the published literature data with the best efficiency of the cycloidal propellers \citep{Haberman1961} and trochoidal propellers \citep{Bose1989a} are shown, as well as the data from DTMB screw propeller 4381 \citep{Hecker1971}.}  \label{fig:ETAvsCTA}\end{figure}%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%\section{Summary}We have presented the results of an experiment conducted to characterize the performance of a trochoidal propeller employing a sinusoidal blade pitch function, and we have presented a theoretical model of cross-flow propellers.  Our experimental data show narrow 95\% confidence bounds, demonstrating high accuracy and repeatability in the experimental methods.   Our theoretical model predictions agree well with the experimental data for all quantities of interest.  We have shown that high-pitch sinusoidal-$\beta$ propellers exceed the efficiency of high-pitch cycloidal-$\beta$ propellers over a wide range of thrust coefficients; however, both of these high-pitch propellers have lower efficiencies than either a low-pitch cycloidal-$\beta$  propeller or a typical screw propeller for a wide range of $C_T$ considered herein.  It should be noted that no studies to date have considered $\beta(\phi)$ pitch functions that are asymmetric about $\phi=\pi$, such that the upstream and downstream portions of the motion are different.  Since the downstream foils pass through the wakes of the upstream foils, it is reasonable to assume that the optimal pitch on the downstream side ($\pi < \phi < 2\pi$) should be different than that on the upstream side ($0 < \phi < \pi$).  We have validated a theoretical model that can be used to further explore and optimize the $\beta(\phi)$ motions of both low-pitch and high-pitch cross-flow propellers, leading to new avenues for improvements in marine propulsion system design.%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%       Nomenclature%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%\clearpage\pagebreak%\section*{Nomenclature}%~\\{\bf Nomenclature}\\\def\arraystretch{1.2}\begin{tabular}{l l l}\hline%\textbf{Variable}	& \textbf{Description}                        & \textbf{Units} \\ \hline$\alpha$         & angle of attack                      & [rad] \\$\beta$  			& blade pitch angle                      & [rad] \\$\Gamma$				& circulation								& [m$^2$/s] \\$\nu$           	& fluid kinematic viscosity             & [m$^2$/s] \\$\phi$          & orbit angle       			 		& [rad] \\$\rho$			& fluid density                         & [kg/m$^3$] \\$\omega$		& rotation speed						& [rad/s] \\%$A$				& propeller frontal area (capture area)  & [m$^2$]  \\$A_p$			& blade planform area   		& [m$^2$] \\$b$           	& foil span                              & [m] \\$c$           	& foil chord                             & [m] \\$D$ 			& rotor diameter						& [m] 		\\$n$				& rotation speed 						& [rev/s] \\$Q$ 			& rotor  torque						& [Nm] 		\\$Q_s$ 			& blade spindle  torque						& [Nm] 		\\$R$ 			& rotor radius							& [m] 		\\$S$ 			& power-averaged spindle torque 	& [Nm] \\$t$             & time                                  & [s] \\$T$				& thrust								& [N] \\$V_s$ 			& ship speed (advance speed)			& [m/s] \\$Z$				& number of blades						& \\$\eta$			& \multicolumn{2}{l}{efficiency, $\eta = {\langle T \rangle V_s}/{\langle Q+S \rangle}\omega$ }  \\$\lambda$		& \multicolumn{2}{l}{absolute advance coefficient, $\lambda \equiv V_s / \omega R$ 	}  \\$\sigma$ 		& solidity, $\sigma \equiv Zc/\pi D$ & \\$\AR$     	& blade aspect ratio, $\AR \equiv b^2/A_p$ 	& \\%$C_Q$ 		& \multicolumn{2}{l}{rotor torque coefficient,   $C_Q \equiv \langle Q \rangle / \half\rho V_s^2 A R$ 	}  \\$C_S$ 		& \multicolumn{2}{l}{spindle torque coefficient, $C_S \equiv \langle S \rangle / \half\rho V_s^2 A R$ 	}  \\$C_T$ 		& \multicolumn{2}{l}{thrust coefficient,    $C_T \equiv \langle T \rangle / \half\rho V_s^2 A$ 	}  \\%$K_Q$ 		& \multicolumn{2}{l}{rotor torque coefficient,   $K_Q \equiv \langle Q \rangle / \rho n^2D^3 (\tfrac{4}{\pi}A)$ 	}  \\%$K_T$ 		& \multicolumn{2}{l}{thrust coefficient,   $K_T \equiv \langle T \rangle / \rho n^2D^2 (\tfrac{4}{\pi}A)$ 	}  \\$\Re$     & \multicolumn{2}{l}{Reynolds number, $\mathit{Re} \equiv  \sqrt{V_s^2 + (\omega R)^2}c/\nu$ }  \\% $\sigma$ & solidity, $\sigma \equiv \frac{Zc}{\pi D}$ & \\[1 em]\hline\end{tabular}\vspace{1 em}%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% \clearpage\section*{Acknowledgements}  We would like to thank the Jere A.\ Chase Ocean Engineering Laboratory at the University of New Hampshire for allowing us to use their towing tank facility.

This offset may be explained by the fact that baseline friction measurements (detailed in \S\ref{subsec:loadmeas}) were made prior to the test runs. Frictional losses decrease as the machine runs for a longer time, so the measured friction losses may be higher than that actual frictional losses experienced during test runs, causing the corrected $C_Q$ and $C_S$ values to be slightly higher than the theoretical prediction. ,v
