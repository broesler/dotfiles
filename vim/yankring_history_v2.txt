The problem of mechanical marine propulsion has existed for at least two millenia, since the time of Archimedes. Only relatively recently has the demand for greater propulsive efficiency pushed the envelope of novel propulsion mechanisms. One of the most promising such mechanisms is a system of tandem, in-line flapping foils.,V

While screw propellers offer marvelous advantages with regards to mechanical simplicity (just need to turn the shaft!), they have practical limits (\eg cavitation) on foil aspect ratio that place lower bounds on friction losses, and, in turn, upper bounds on overall hydrodynamic efficiency.,V
