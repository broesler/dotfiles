From: Brenden Epps <brenden.epps@dartmouth.edu>To: "Gina M. Calabrese" <Gina.M.Calabrese@dartmouth.edu>, Bernie Roesler <Bernard.T.Roesler.TH@dartmouth.edu>Date: Fri, 26 Jun 2015 16:44:16 -0400Subject: Rheometer specsHi Gina,Here are the tentative specifications of the slurry materials (either oneor the other of these cases):1.  Switchgrass immersed in water.  Slurry is 15% solids by volume.  Solidsparticles are grass clippings roughly cylindrical shaped, 12 mm long and 2mm in diameter.2.  Corn stover immersed in water.  Slurry is 15% solids by volume.  Solidsparticles are roughly 2mm diameter spheres.Bernie,Can you please do a literature search and find out the viscosity of thesematerials?  I need to spec out a viscometer to measure the viscosity ofthis slurry mixture for Lee's project.   Can you please find viscosity ortorque data in the literature to help me spec out the viscometer?-Brenden,V
