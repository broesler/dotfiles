% integrated design procedure, rather than linear design procedure outlined here.  % \it{Multi-objective optimization:}  Propulsors have a number of design requirements for different operational modes of the ship, and these design requirements may be at odds with one another  \citep{Carlton1994}: % \it{(i)} during cruise operation, the propulsor needs to produce the requisite thrust at high propulsive efficiency, produce constant thrust, and produce no side force;% \it{(ii)}   for docking and undocking operations, it must provide adequate thrust at low speeds; % \it{(iii)}  for maneuvering operations, it must afford thrust vectoring;  % \it{(iv)}   for survivability, it should provide mechanical redundancy;% \it{(v)}    for stealth, it should avoid cavitation.% What does a tandem foil propulsor optimized for each of these requirements look like?  What are the tradeoffs involved in multi-objective design optimization? % J. S. Carlton. Marine Propellers and Propulsion.

%choose the aft foil phase lag $\phi \approx 90^\circ$ or $180^\circ$ to mitigate unsteady variation in thrust or side force, respectively.  ,V
% Alternatively, for a given (target) thrust coefficient $C_T$, the induced velocity can be estimated from actuator disk theory: $u_x/U = (-1 + \sqrt{1+C_T})/2$, such that $U^\ast \approx U  (1 + \sqrt{1+C_T})/2$ could be used to initialize $s$.,v
% However, we hypothesize that by deliberately choosing inter-foil phase lag $\phi$ and spacing $s$, one can design a tandem flapping foil propulsor that both (\emph{i}) produces high thrust at high efficiency, and (\emph{ii}) mitigates unsteady variation in thrust or side force.,V

% Thus, define the \it{coefficient of variation} (similar to the definition from statistics) as the standard deviation of the load normalized by the mean thrust:,V
% {\color{red} Prior research with tandem flapping foils shows two trends that are useful for practical propulsor design: (1) the time-varying side force $Y_1(t)+Y_2(t)$ is minimized when the foils flap $180^\circ$ out of phase ($\phi \approx 180^\circ$), and (2) unsteady variations in thrust $X_1(t)+X_2(t)$ are minimized when the aft foil trails the forward foil by one quarter period ($\phi \approx 90^\circ$).},V

% \citet{Boschitsch2014} performed a comprehensive experimental study, varying inter-foil spacing $s$ from $0 < s/c \le 4$ and phase lag from $0 \leq \phi \leq 2\pi$; they found that thrust production and propulsive efficiency of the upstream foil was nearly the same as that of an isolated foil for spacings $s/c > 0.5$ (independent of phase). %{\color{red} \it{Gabe:  What do you think of the following argument?}   We postulate that this is true because the main effect of the downstream foil on the upstream foil is to induce axial inflow (\emph{i.e.} the time-averaged $u_x > 0$, but $u_y \approx 0$).  This is akin to contra-rotating propellers, where the downstream rotor induces axial-, but not swirl velocity on the upstream rotor~\cite{Coney1989,Hough1964}. \it{The problem with this comparison, though, is that the forward propeller in a contra-rotating pair will have a much different load distribution that an isolated propeller would, so perhaps it's not a good analogy.}%},V
% the engineering tradeoff between a single-foil propulsor and a tandem-foil propulsor  reason for accepting the added mechanical complexity of a tandem foil propulsor is to minimize the unsteady loads.% {\color{red} Has anyone shown that $\phi = 90^\circ$ minimize unsteady variation in thrust?}%% These observations stem from the work of \citet{Gopalkrishnan1994}, who was the first to observe that a flapping foil in the wake of an upstream body can actively cancel, reposition, or enhance incident vorticty.%,V
%,V
%% For example, dragonflies, which has a fixed inter-wing spacing, flap in phase ($\phi = 0$) for high acceleration (i.e.\ high thrust), and they flap out of phase ($\phi = 180^\circ$) during cruise (i.e.\ when zero net vertical force $Y(t)$ is desirable) \citep{Alexander1984,Thomas2004}.%,V
% {\color{blue}% \it{3.\ The unsteady variation in thrust or side force is correlated with the aft foil phase lag $\phi$} \citep{Alexander1984,Thomas2004}.  Thus, these unsteady variations may be minimized by appropriate choice of $\phi$.% [150313 BROESLER]:,V
% Thus, for a given $\phi$ chosen to mitigate unsteady loads, the spacing $s$ can be chosen to optimize the interactions of the downstream foil with incident vorticity (which was shed by the upstream foil).,v
%We propose the following simplified design process:%The general steps in a simplified design process are as follows:,V
%The lift and drag forces act roughly at the quarter-chord, added mass loads at the mid-chord, and acceleration reaction loads at the mass centroid.  The moment $Q_i(t)$ includes the $M_3$ and $-I\ddot\theta$ terms above and additional moments due to the above forces not acting through the pitching location, $p_i$.  It is evident then that the choice of pitching location affects the unsteady loads and moments acting on the propulsor and thus overall efficiency.,V
%These forces and torques can be conceptualized as the resultant of six key physical effects \cite{Roesler2014OMAEconf}: quasi-steady lift $0.5\rho V^2 C_L c\, (= \rho V \Gamma)$, quasi-steady drag $0.5\rho V^2 C_D c$, lift modification due to flow curvature $0.5\rho V^2 C_L^* c$ \citep{migliore1980}, unsteady lift $\rho c \, d\Gamma/dt$, added mass loads (e.g.\ 2D flat plate $F_1$, $F_2$, and $M_3$), and acceleration reaction loads ($-ma$ and $-I\ddot\theta$), where $V$ is the total inflow speed. % (freestream plus wake-induced velocity).  %,V
