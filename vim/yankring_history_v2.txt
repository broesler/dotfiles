% {\color{red} [BROESLER 150408 DISCREPANCY]: In the 2012/13 ENGS 89/90 report, we cite amplified cycloidal motion as%   $$ \beta = a \cdot \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{\frac{1}{e} \sin \phi}{1 + \frac{1}{e} \cos \phi}\right) $$%   I'm not sure where this came from, but it does match to Riijarvi's paper, where the pitch function was ``max angle $20\deg$'' corresponding to $e = 2.924 = \frac{1}{\sin20\deg}$, even though they report%   $$ \beta = a \cdot \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{\sin\beta_{max} \cos \phi}{1 + \sin\beta_{max} \sin \phi}\right) $$% This equation is wrong. The switching of the $\sin$ and $\cos$ terms is due to their definition of $\phi$ being offset $90\deg$ from the \CR definition. It does not affect the coefficients. If they were talking about $\beta_{abs}$ vs $\beta$, I don't think adding $\phi$ would change the eccentricity value, it just affects the wrapping to $\pi$.}%end color red% % [BROESLER 150420]: There is no discrepancy if you derive the formulae for {beta(phi),beta_abs(phi)} from the actual geometry, and THEN use the definition e = a/R = P/(pi*D).,V

The propeller itself was designed with the specifications shown in Table~\ref{tab:experiments}. The blade section geometry was chosen to be a NACA0015 at the root, linearly tapering to a NACA0008 at the tip. blades were milled from hardwood, and epoxy coated. Steel plates were embedded in the blades to add stiffness and provide a location on which to weld the blade shafts. The shafts were placed at $c_{pp} = 0.25c$. Actual rotor diameter was $D = 0.3175$ m, with $c/D = 0.47$, and $b/D = 2.36$.  ,V

% Figure~\ref{fig:w2015CQSA} also contains an additional curve (dashed line), which is a fourth-order polynomial fit to the experimental data points. Given that $\eta$ is calculated with $C_Q^A$ in the denominator, any error in the measurement is magnified. Instead of using the raw data points, this best-fit curve is used in conjunction with $C_T^A$ to calculate $\eta$ \eqref{eq:eta}. This curve fitting technique was also employed by \citet{Bose1989a} to smooth noise in the $\eta$ curve. ,V
