Comments on thrust or side force?,V
These measurements are less prevalent in the literature than thrust and torque measurements, though they are generally of a higher magnitude than the thrust forces \cite{Ficken1969,Dickerson1975}. We find the same trend in our experiment. The presence of large side forces presents a serious practical concern to the implementation of these propellers in commercial shipping ventures. A vertical-axis propeller will cause the stern of a ship to swing sidewards without proper resistive force, or the balancing force of a second propeller. A horizontal-axis propeller will tend to trim the ship either bow up or down, depending on the direction of propeller rotation. Further work must be done in modeling and measuring these side forces.,v

{\color{blue} Perhaps the most fascinating result of this experiment is that both trochoidal and cycloidal propellers, which generate thrust by shedding a vortex street in addition to a lift force, have nearly identical performance curves to screw propellers, which only generate thrust through lift, not vortex shedding.} When compared with screw propellers, the cycloidal propeller of \cite{Haberman1961} nearly matches the performance of DTMB propeller 4381. ,v
